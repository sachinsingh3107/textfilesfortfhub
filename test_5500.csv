I have not used the microphone yet so I can't say how well it works. As headphones they have nice bass, and the sound is great. Overall they are a good set of headphones. They also fold up, making it easy to store."
286034,123,Ashish,positive,positive,positive,Not discussed,Not discussed,Not discussed,negative,Not discussed,Not discussed,Not discussed,These sound great noise cancelling now better than bose. The sound out of these headphones blows bose out of the water also. Good app for the headphones. You have to have them adjusted just right to be comfortable for long periods but once you find that sweet spot can wear for hours and hours and the sound is awesome out of the headphones. Hard to find replacement pads though.1/18/2018I just want to add something for amazon it would be alot better to see reviews from people that pay not a bunch of reviews from people that receive the product for free. I have been noticing alot more vine reviews and they are always high because duh they are receiving a free product this is a shady practice in my opinion. I want a real review of someone that is willing to come off 400.00 of their hard earned money then give a review.
292398,129,Shahrukh,positive,Not discussed,Not discussed,positive,Not discussed,positive,Not discussed,Not discussed,Not discussed,Not discussed,They sound pretty good and say in place well for running. They paired easily with 2 different phones. Right now my only complaint is the small light on them stopped workingUpdate::  September 15 2018.  The head phones stopped working after a few months very disappointedUpdate Oct 22 2018: I contacted Anker and they honored their warranty and replaced the headphones quickly. The customer service was outstanding. They even followed up with an email asking if the replacement headphones were working. Like I said their customer service is top notch

My biggest complaint is that they are way too large for my ears and there isn't anyway to adjust them. Also a bit bulky(for me atleast)  The sound quality and noise cancelation is great though.

Cannot make phone calls as the headphones pick up a massive amount of outside noise. You will be unable to make phone calls in any place with noise.

291161,128,kanishka,positive,Not discussed,negative,Not discussed,Not discussed,Not discussed,positive,Not discussed,Not discussed,Not discussed,Sound good for the price. Easy enough to control. A bit bulky in appearance and the tone that pearces the skull when you Max out the volume has got to go before some poor desperate schmuck like myself sues them for damages. It's not the high volume that'll cost you your hearing it's the human dog whistle that  hits you and makes you want to kill the genius who thought of it. You can see just how traumatic the experience was on me!

287084,124,kanishka,Not discussed,Not discussed,Not discussed,Not discussed,Not discussed,Not discussed,positive,Not discussed,Not discussed,positive,"We tried these out while at target... comparing against all of the other big name headsets.  I do wish they would use the same song for every headset but even so my boyfriend and I both agreed that these were amazing... We felt the bass and clarity were far better on these than the other headphones we tried.  I bought a pair for my bf for gaming, watching him grin while listening to Destiny 2 while wearing the headset made the $150 so worth it. I'm going to get myself a set next, I like them for music and gaming... whereas the bass is epic it doesn't rest on that being the wow factor. We can hear the clarity in movement of other players while gaming or subtle nuances in music you might miss otherwise.  I've always been a huge skullcandy fan but thus is my bf's first skullcandy anything... he's now a huge fan.So for gaming or music they are amazing.  I do wish we could game wireless, also, and this is a universal issue it seems , a bit more padding on the part that rests on your head would be nice.  His head is bigger and I have more hair for padding... so it's a little less of an issue for me.We are so happy with the headset that those don't knock a start off for us, just felt it was worth a mention.(Trying them out at target is a great idea, they don't do price matching tho, we checked our military base store,  which does price match with Amazon, but they didn't carry Crusher, only the other ones. In case our experience helps! Lol)"

I decided to wait on giving a review of these to see if they actually did last. I???m happy to report that I???ve had this for almost a full month and they are still working as good as the first day. Because of my disability there are six things I look for when buying wireless earbuds:1. Ease of use2. Can I put them in myself?3. Can I plug them into the charge port myself?4. Battery Life5. Call Quality6. PriceI can tell you that the above six things were very true in my experience with these earbuds. Because I have a disability it is time-consuming for me to plug them into the charge port myself but it can be done. Ease of use exceeded my expectations. It didn???t even take me 30 seconds to pair them with my iPhone. Lastly, it does take some work but I can get them in my ears myself. At night I just use the left earbud when I???m listening to my audiobook or music.  Listening to music does drain the battery life but it???s really not that big of a deal. I have fallen asleep listening to an audiobook, and I wake up at 8 o???clock in the morning and my earbuds are still going. I haven???t really tested out the 12.5 hour battery claim though. For my needs, these are the best ones for the price. Best $35 and change I???ve spent in a long time. **NOTE** I wanted to add something after reading one review today. The earbuds do have a warning beep when they are low on power, you just have to know what to listen for. If you choose to ignore the warning beep, they will eventually shut off on their own. However, I haven???t had a problem of the earbuds just powering off. **NOTE 2** December 5, 2017: I just recently upgraded my phone from the iPhone 7+ to the iPhone X and I can tell you that these pair really well with the newer phone. Just Make sure your device is in discover mode. Also when pairing them with a different device it will not flash blue and red, as it did with your initial pairing; it will flash blue only, and kinda fast. ????"

I used them with an Android Pixel XL and no problem.  Plus you can also use NFC to pair them which is a great plus.This said, I downloaded the app and it was useless as I could not initially pair my headphones to it ??? it kept telling me to put them in pairing mode, which I would, but it still would not pair.  I use these w/o the mobile app.Sound:Sound was EASILY the best of the bunch ??? I tried 5 headsets (see other reviews).  The bass is deep. Maybe this is possible because they are so huge in your ear!Fit:Fit excellent once on the ear ??? also the best of all I tried.  Super fast and easy to put in and out and I love the clip on the back to ensure you don???t loose them.  I lost my last set (Epic 2s) because although they were wrapped over my neck, I forgot about them and they fell off.  Use the clip!These are HUGE buds though.  Silly Huge.  But the trade off is the great sound i guess.Call Quality:I know its not their primary function but call quality (on receiver end) was terrible.  It seems there is no mic function at all I have to hold the phone up to my face, which defeats the purpose of hands free.Overall, of all the sets I tried, these were the ones I picked.  As a bonus I got a cyber Monday deal and got them for $99!My only complaint (other than call quality) is I wish they were slightly smaller, and the battery lasted longer.  It seems to drain much faster than all the others I tried.I have also tried Apple Airpods, Bose Soundsport, Epic 2 BT, and the LG HBS730, and Jaba Elite.  See other reviews, but the bose were my final choice with the Epic a close second."

First impression: sounds good! The bass was a little overwhelming honestly but to me that was a plus since I would have mainly used these in the gym. While the bass is booming, mids and highs were still there. One negative i noticed quickly was that the headphone drivers pop out past the ears quite a lot due to their length, to the point where they are a tad unsightly.I am writing this review on the second day of owning these and unfortunately, I noticed leaving the house that the sound is choppy on quite a consistent basis. I get on the train and everything seems ok, but then get out and notice it again. Of course, I then realize that the bluetooth distance from my ears to my pants pocket are too long. Really? Sure enough, i take my phone out and lift it above the waist and it sounds fine again, put it back under the waist and it gets choppy again. Perhaps I got a defective pair, but these are unusable to me. I had high hopes based on the sound but this is a bit of an unredeemable problem. Easy return for me.Edit: soundpeats reached out and IMMEDIATELY sent out an updated version of the product that works great. I guess I had received a deffective unit but honestly thanks to the reliability of the company and the fact that these headphones really do sound amazing and bassy for the price and the fact that they are bluetooth, I would buy again from soundpeats."

I guess that's to be expected for $30 Bluetooth headphones but I still expected more.  They skip whether I am walking or running with them which is extremely annoying.  The sound quality I would describe as adequate but not great.  To make up for the lack of quality, Senso gives you a TON of extras: case, multiple charging cords, extra ear buds, etc which really aren't necessary.  Better quality would be more appreciated.  They describe them as ""noise canceling"", but in reality I could hear plenty of street noise, more than I expected.  Going back to my Tao Tronics Bluetooth headphones.

With that out of the way, over the year, I've suffered through countless cheap earbuds and this pair stands out *for the money.*The Fit - As you'll see in the pictures, they have that design that really digs into your ears. It's very snug, possibly so much so that some people will be put off by the buds, and they really won't fall out with even erratic head-shaking. They include interchangeable rubber tips both bigger and smaller than the default, if you're so inclined, to get the fit you're looking for. This snug, deep ear fit also provides a notable degree of muting outside noise. Good for cars, airplanes, buses, trains, that sort of thing with noise polution. Good choice for runners. If you've used headphones with this design and didn't like the fit, these won't be any better for you. Everyone seems to have their own preferences in regards to that.The Bass - Very respectable for the price. If this is your budget and you care for the low frequencies, this pair is worthy of your 7 bucks.The Mids - Mids always seem to take a hit with cheap earbuds. This is no exception. There's notable frequency drops. I'm playing songs I know back and forth in high fidelity and you lose a lot of the song when you aren't willing to pay more. This pair performs well for the budget; I'm merely stating this so buyers are aware that no matter how many stars a 7 buck pair of earbuds have, there's no escaping the reality that you get what you pay for.The Highs - Average for the price. Nothing special. Again, notable frequency drops, which is to be expected. When your max budget is 10 bucks, you're going to lose a lot of the song, guaranteed, and you just can't avoid it.Anything Else Worth Noting - A lot of 10 and under earbuds have heavy noise. Basically, when you plug them in, you get this hissing sound which is fairly typical for cheap audio. This is a problem that really haunts the low-end budgets. This pair has very little hiss to it in addition to the outside noise pollution getting a notable mute which is definitely a value for 10 and under earbuds. The sound quality for the price ranges from what I've heard from similarly priced buds to better. No remote - take that as you will. The pin itself, outside of your player, doesn't stick straight up as some do and bends, making an L shape. I typically find that to be better for people on the go, just because it's easier to knock a pin that doesn't bend in which can damage both the player and the buds. At the end of the day, if you're only in it for podcasts, audiobooks, lowfi audio or constrained in your budget, this is a fantastic choice. *But* there's so much more quality to audio out there (I promise you), if you're willing to pay for it, so keep that in mind before you buy. This isn't some miracle earbud that gives you a 300 dollar sound for 7 bucks. This is simply a respectable performance for 7 bucks. This *is* a better product than most of whatever 15-20 dollar earbuds they're randomly selling at the front of your local store. I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could, but I can't, so 4 seems more reasonable. Hope this helps."

If you are ever doing a workout that partially covers or completely covers the plastic part of the headphones where the increase volume, decrease volume, and power buttons are located, it will start to skip.  Upon further investigation, if you completely cover this part of the device, the connection will die out completely.I am going to have to assume that this is where the bluetooth is located?

Easy to use and connectivity has also been great.Now. Sound quality is fantastic BUT ....my phone (LgV30) is equipped with a fancy DAC for HiFi audio on the headphone jack. I need to use corded headphones to take advantage of it so I do notice a quality difference when switching to Bluetooth.

I can hear my own footsteps running though, but that's just an affect of noise cancelling headphones.

I make it a point to reach out to the company first before leaving my feedback.  They are very interested in improving the ""over the ear"" and the ""in ear"" models.1. The power button is right where you have to press to push the earpiece into your ear or readjust it.  I would change the power connector and the power button and put each where the other is or move it to the front of the side piece so that it is still in a predominant area but not where you push to get it to fit in your ear where you want it.2. The over the ear holders basically don't do much because they don't bend to shape and don't sit against your head as they stick outward a bit before curving back and around the ear.3. I realize that these are directed towards those who run , however, the treble needs to be improved a lot.For those that can adjust the EQ on their devices I would suggest using the ""bass reducer"" (I own an iPhone) to get more of a good overall sound quality.  The highs are muffled a bit too much for me and I have used different in ear covers just to see if that was part of the problem.4. I do like the soft memory foam ear covers though.5. The rubber covered wire that connects the two ear pieces is very memory retaining and won't lay comfortably against the neck.Other than the nuances above I do think the sound is really good but if you want really great sound go ahead and spend 300 bucks on a Bose or Beats by Dre unit. You cannot beat the sound from these at this price.  I would have paid over 70 for these."

After fumbling with the apple wired earbuds for the past year while hiking I decided to research a set of BT Wireless buds. These SENSO wireless headphones had many 4 and 5 star reviews. Actually I think they had better reviews than the Major Brands which sell for $150-200. Several reviews talked about Excellent Customer Service as well as great quality. I cannot comment on Bass being good or bad since my only reference is the apple brand wired ear buds which I never felt were of great quality or fit. Not sure what ears apple was trying to fit?  I think the volume and bass in these Senso headphones are great. Sound quality is awesome. Waterproof feature seems great. I have had them for a couple weeks and I hike 5-7 miles a day and definitely give them a good sweat test. No issues. Connecting is a breeze. The ""hooks"" that go above your ears are so comfortable, they're soft and flexible and even with my glasses on, there is no pressure points or areas that are uncomfortable. I never even feel them.  The controls all work great. Funny, the volume up and down seem to be backwards to what I naturally would expect, but in a day was used to the setup.  I have Nike+ Apple Watch and have read it works great with it as well, but have not had the opportunity to try them connected directly to the watch since my hikes have elevation gains I want to track and the watch does not track elevation so I pair with the phone, start my music and launch NRC on the phone. The microphone works great, I have had several calls come in during a hike and have never had any connection issues, static or anything else. I have asked the first few people who called if it sounded ok and they all said perfect.  The customer service is amazing. I got an immediate response to an inquiry and two follow ups on the issue as well as follow ups from the ceo regarding the purchase and my satisfaction.  I RECOMMEND THESE TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY. I would repurchase these in the future should I need another set.  Customer Service also offered, free of charge to send spare cushions for the ear bud part.

I EQ'd while connected to my phone and computer and could never balance things out properly. The bass is so intense that it really muffles anything on the rest of the spectrum. I bought these so that I could listen to music and take a phone call as needed while at the office, but the mic quality is awful. I attempted to make a couple phone calls in my office at work and my home office and the audio was so poor that using them for calls simply wasn't an option. I returned them and purchased a similar item.The positives: they have great battery life. Although I didn't use them for long phone calls, I did listen to music on them for 7+ hours a day and found that the battery life on them was around 9 hours, which was more than I expected. They charge quick and are easy to use. The additional accessories were really nice to have, so I'm disappointed that I had to send them back."

I purchased these to use with my iPhone and Apple watching while outside doing yard work. The headphones charged up quick and connected to both devices easy. However when I got outside I had a lot of issues. My phone was less than 5 ft away from me and my watch was on my wrist. The headphones kept cutting out unless I stuck the watch right by the headphones. I then disconnected it from my watch and had to carry my phone around in my pocket which kind of defeated the purpose of why I got them. When connected to my phone they worked great and I didn???t lose power while using them for about 6 hours. They just didn???t seem to stay connected to my watch very well.

I was also surprised they do block some external noise.  I don't remember reading anything saying they would, but they do.  I wear them for about five hours a day while working on my computer and they are very comfortable.  The battery lasts a little over a day, so between 6 and 8 hours of continuous use.

The slightest interference will cause the Bluetooth to cut out.Example: If I hold my phone in my left hand down by my side while walking, the bluetooth audio will cut in and out so I have to hold my phone with my right hand. If I hold my phone under my left arm, say if I need to use both hands for something, the audio cuts out. In my left pocket, is also troublesome. Seems to work well only if I hold the phone on my right side.I've since bought the BOSE over-ear bluetooth headphones. I works perfectly no matter where the phone is. I can walk into the next room and it still works. I bought the over-ear BOSE headphones because when I go running it cuts out wind noise. That's something the SENSO does not do, even walking on a windy day.Update: I reset everything and repaired with my Galaxy S9 per SENSO recommendation. Still, reception is horrible.Example: Sitting on a workout bench at LA Fitness. I lay the phone on the floor on my left side of the bench so I could workout. Audio cuts in/out so I have to move the phone to the right side of the bench. Distance in both cases from phone to this SENSO headset, 3-4 feet.Example: Sitting on a bench doing row pulls, again phone must be on the right side of the bench in order to get a good reception. Distance from headset - 3 feet.Example: Walking down the street holding my Galaxy S9 in my left hand, audio will go in/out as my arm swings in the walk so I have to hold the phone in my right hand to keep the audio going.Now I use a BOSE headset. 10x the distance and once while listening to music I walked away from the treadmill I was using and left my phone behind. Didn't realize it until I got about 50 ft away and the audio started dropping out.Sorry to report, I would recommend these SENSO headphones."

I will use them for a half hour at about half volume, turn them off, and when I try to use them again a couple days later they are completely dead. No charge. I end up not being able to use them at all.It really is a shame because I love Aukey products and all my others work great, maybe these were just defective. I would've given them 5 stars otherwise, but based on my experience I would recommend going with the Anker equivalent to these and you would probably have better luck.UPDATE:After posting an initial 3 star review due to a battery issue, Aukey reached out to me and sent a replacement unit at no cost. After using these for a few days they seem to work perfectly, so the first unit must have been a defect. I highly recommend Aukey products and am very pleased by their customer service."

I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don't even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8"" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn't function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn't think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said ""We like to take care of our customers"".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out."

I liked the features of the headphones over the other brand. I've use the older version of the bose and loved them so much I wanted some bluetooth ones.

I got white noise when not listening to anything. I got even more white noise when not listening to anything and plugged in with the cable.2) Ears got warm. Couldn't keep these on longer then a couple of hours before becoming uncomfortable. I've used bose for 15-18 hours without problems.3) Besides my ears getting warm, the headphones are a little tight on my head. Could tell if that's why I got headaches or the white noise.4) My ears also touched the inside of the cups. There isn't a lot of room inside the cups for your ears.Conclusion-I want $350 headphones to be comfortable and not get hot. The features are great but I want comfort too.

I used them daily ...mostly at the gym but also when cycling and on runs.  Initially there was some growing pains, especially with running and the headphones popping out but the different size buds do make a difference in terms of snug fit.The reason I'm giving them such a low review is that they're just not durable.  When you pay over $100 for headphones, you expect them to last a year or so.  Even 6-7 months into it, when going for bike rides I noticed that sound would drop out here and there if I held my neck in a certain way.  But after 11 or so months they have just fallen apart.  The covering of the bluetooth/on button has slipped off entirely and now the the bluetooth button is exposed, they don't work at all.I've not abused the headphones in any way and by and large they are well taken care of.  But even with hard, regular use, I would expect the quality to be much better in terms of build, especially from an 'elite' and certainly pricey, headphone manufacturer like Bose.  I've switched to the Jabra Elite 65t, as I don't want to purchase bose sport headphones anymore (I still love my QC35's) and so far so good, but the jury will be out til I see how well they hold up over the next year."
