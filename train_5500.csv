292478,129,SIDAK,positive,Not discussed,positive,Not discussed,Not discussed,Not discussed,positive,Not discussed,Not discussed,Not discussed,I was skeptical. No doubt now these are fantastic. I bought them to replace my jabra sport paces. They looked similar and I prefer the over the ear hold. They sound amazing. Have an excellent fit in the ear. Includes multiple pieces to change and customize the fit. Very good sound quality. Extremely happy. Hands down would purchase again compared to bigger name competition prices.

286268,123,SIDAK,Not discussed,Not discussed,neutral,Not discussed,Not discussed,Not discussed,Not discussed,positive,Not discussed,Not discussed,They are good but a little on the small side for a 6??? male with probably larger than normal ears. The Bose 35s are more comfortable to wear for hours. I have taken these on (2) 30 hour overseas trips and the battery lasted the entire trip which is no small feet. I picked these vs the Bose because I like the integrated controls better. Once you get the hang of the touch controls it is nice....not perfect but nice.
292077,129,SIDAK,neutral,Not discussed,positive,Not discussed,Not discussed,Not discussed,positive,neutral,Not discussed,negative,"Of all the under-$30 headphones I've used, this one is the best. Hands down.I used to own the Soundbuds Slim (before I lost them...), and those were also great. But these things last WAY longer (mine haven't died on me yet, and I charged them three days ago) and have a slightly better sound. They also fit very well. Once you get over how big they are, they feel amazing.The neck clip is a godsend, because the wire on these tends to flop around, and the volume controller weighs it unevenly to the right. If you're going running with these or walking a long time, you may want to use the clip to keep yourself from going crazy.A note on the sound. For the price, it's unbeatable. Remember that these are bluetooth earphones for under thirty bucks, so don't expect Sennheiser. That being said, it's still noticeably worse than a good pair of wired earphones at a similar price - the bass is way too much and the treble feels muted. You won't be getting very sharp or crystal clear sounds from these. But if you use your phone's equalizer, you're not a sound connoisseur, and you're willing to sacrifice a little to get a pair of headphones at a ridiculously affordable price, you won't be disappointed.Lastly, the case is awesome. It's a bit tough to put them away at first, but usually I just use three fingers to wrap them up and shove it in. Works sometimes, every time. But besides that, it's a wonderful case, MILES better than the shoddy bag they include with the Soundbuds Slim.Kudos to Anker for putting such a good product out there for this price."

308102,145,SIDAK,positive,positive,Not discussed,Not discussed,Not discussed,neutral,Not discussed,Not discussed,Not discussed,Not discussed,The sound quality is great. The noise cancellation is amazing. One thing I noticed about most true wireless buds is when outside in open spaces it's best to try and keep your phone close to the buds for the best sound quality otherwise the buds and phone have a harder time staying connected  because of the open environment. These are a must buy!! I really enjoy them.

I have some backup headphones in my gym bag- motorola s305. The motos were not advertised as sweatproof (Ankers are advertised as such) but they have worked pretty well for a long period of time....

Midrange sounds like a grainy shell of a sound. BT in general isn???t great but these are bad. My apple earbuds which barely stay in my ears sound tremendously better than these and they were free.

I liked the style and the features.I have a 4yr old son and 5yr old daughter. My son is just like any other 4yr old boy, destructive. And I must say that the headphone was durable. Easy to put away and carry around. My issue is the wiring. Nowadays, most companies go from hard plastic outing to fiber/mess outing on products that has wiring. The problem with that is no protection for the inside wiring. To loose and flimsy. Two months down the line, the headset wiring had a shortage. Contacted Amazon and no worries. They credited my account. Re-order exact same headphone for son and 2 months later, same issue, shortage in wiring and at the same area, near the base of the headset. So I decided try another brand, but honestly for the headsets I looked for (under $25) the reviews are equally the same. Now my dilemma is to invest in more expensive headsets or keep searching for cost effective ones that I am sure want last past 6 months. Hmmmmm"
284175,121,Akshay,neutral,neutral,positive,positive,Not discussed,Not discussed,Not discussed,positive,Not discussed,Not discussed,"I got these from Amazon a few weeks ago and I was pretty excited about them out of the box. The battery lasts me through about 10 hours of non-continuous music and podcasts during my normal workday. The earpiece is quite comfortable, but doesn't block too much sound so that I don't mind wearing them while I am walking around outside. Sound quality is about what you'd expect from the price.. doesn't compare in any way to my Bose earbuds, but certainly does the job.My main complaint is that after only a few weeks of using them, there is a big ugly chip in the paint coating on one earpiece, and I can tell there are some other chips about to break off too. Really disappointing... my earbuds now look gross and old, even though they are basically brand new. I have kept them around my neck or in their carrying case the whole time I have owned them. Next time I will shell out a little extra money for a product that keeps its integrity a bit longer.EDIT: Customer service reached out to me and offered me a free pair of the updated Q35 earbuds. I really appreciate their willingness to send a new product after mine chipped so quickly. The pair that I received has a different type of coating on the earbud that I think will last much longer. Very happy with them for the past two weeks and I would consider buying again."

I used it on and off at work and running for a month, and I did not need to recharge.I have a very small head, so the thing looks wide and huge on me. But it stays even when I run with it.The one thing I dislike about it (and it may not be the headphones fault) is the + and - buttons on the headphones. You would think it is used to adjust for volume. But instead, they act as more of a forward and backward button; I use it to skip a song, for example."

I attribute this to me never using the carrying case, which folds the headphones up. I believe it's this folding position (or the stress induced in the joints when taking it in and out of the folding position) that causes the breaks. So just don't use that position, and you'll likely be fine.* Audio latency over bluetooth. There is no noticeable latency between audio and visuals if you have the correct audio codecs and device compatability! I understand where it's coming from; I had audio lag on my android phone, but knew it wasn't the headphones since I had no audio lag when using them on my PC with AptX codec. I installed a custom Oreo ROM on my phone (which allows you to specify codecs), and now I'm not getting any noticeable lag, even when using LDAC. So while some devices and software setups do have audio lag (hence the reviews here containing such complaints), it is NOT the case that the headphones are not capable of producing in sync sound; you may just have to work at it a bit.Keywords: lag latency bluetooth cracking sync"

These are by far the best earbuds I have ever owned. The quality of the bass is considerably higher than in other headphones. Also, they are LOUD. If you turn them up loud enough, you will not be able to hear anything else going on around you. This is extremely helpful when you are trying to watch things or listen to things when there are others around who might be making noise. All in all, I would most definitely recommend these."

The cons are they have a shorter than 3.5hr use time, yes I did turn the volume down and up experimenting with use time. There is no (battery full) or medium notification sound when turned on (although the white rings blink notifying you while charging.) Sometimes communication sounds garbled on both ends."

I paired them successfully, as for the ear hooks, for my size ears they are pretty useless. Generic build for average male heads it seems. However, the sound is good and the buds seem to stay nicely in the ears. Shipping was quick enough. Nice little case to keep them in. Sound is good but I am not an audiophile. I use them for walking to and from work. They are pretty new so I can't attest for battery life. If it's good I won't amend my review.Customer support so far is VERY good. They are on top of letting people know any issues that may come up with your smart phone (pro-actively)."

They're also very good at noise isolating. The mic is also very good but you need a little louder than you probably sound normally.

They came with a charge so I could try them out right away. How cool and thoughtful is that! The package is impressive. Everything you need plus more is included. The case is great. Hard shell yet soft to the touch. Stylish as well. Has a net pocket inside.You can easily tell someone(s) asked themselves, ""how can I make this product an even better value to beat the competition?"".A brief history of my headphones from Amazon; These headphones are replacements for the Senbowe bluetooth headphones I bought here in 2015. The Senbowe still work but they fall out of my ear and the cord on the back is tacky and snags my skin which pulls the plugs out of my ear when I turn my head (big design flaw). They are also not very loud. Otherwise they work very similar to these. The Senso is also replacing another pair I tried about 6 months ago which I feel are total garbage: Beyution V4.1 Bluetooth headphones. Those are 'on the ear' style and were cheap plastic garbage which broke. Seller offered to replace them but I didnt want another pair.So with that said, these headphones are made well. They are slightly large looking in my ears but not so goofy that I look like a robot. It's not an issue. The cord on the back of my neck does not snag on my skin and is not tacky. 2 cord clips are included as a bonus. They just keep things tidy and pick up the slack. Nice touch! The headphones are super light and the around ear part is very comfy. Love it. I have large ears and the default plugs worked great for me but they come with other sizes as well included. The box includes a couple USB cords and a card charging port (how thoughtful and great!).The sound I feel is only slightly bass heavy but I need more time to determine how I like that. It sounded great when I tried them for 5 minutes.I was very impressed by how loud they are! I was also very impressed with the outside sound suppression. I listened to music near my AC window unit and I couldn't hear it! It was on high. This is getting close to my higher end Bose 25 headphones with active noise reduction (requires a battery for those headphones). Super impressive! That was a big surprise. I honestly didn't think it would be as good as it is. I use headphones in the gym and I don't want to listen to the loud pop music they play at all.The controls work fine. I haven't tried the phone feature yet. Hooking up to a wireless Bluetooth connection was breeze. The instructions included are simple and easy to follow. The case also included a pamphlet on how to get support which I hear is excellent but hope to never use.Bottom line. Best value headphone set/package I have every found and at a price point which is great! Win/Win. Rock on!"

But last night, the left side started going out.  It would crackle and intermittently go on and off depending how i moved it around.  From experimenting, it appears the problem originates where the wire comes out of the right side to go to the left.  Holding the right earbud and moving it around a little would cause the left earbud to come on and go off intermittently.  I really liked these, but am definitely let down by the fact that with the little amount of use, and treating them gently over the last year that I've had them, that they would stop working properly.  It's possible that this pair somehow slipped past quality control.  I don't think I've ever had a pair of bluetooth headphones that broke down after one year, because as I've stated, I've always treated my gear very carefully and gently.  I have been using these headphones for 3-4 hours, one day a week (Fridays) for online gaming and that's it."

The sound is super low and I hate it. I will NOT be buying again and I regret purchasing. The sound and bass is good for the price, nothing outstanding.

They block out most outside noise making it easy to concentrate on my activity, finding them much more convenient than headphones.  Sometimes I wear them to block out noises when I take the occaisional nap. They are holding up better than any other earbud product I have used.

The quality falls between my JBL Reflect Contours and Power Beats 3 at more than half the cost. They are bass heavy, which I don't mind. If you buy them you won't have any regrets or buyers remorse.  Over the last 2 weeks of heavy use I did notice a couple of things that I didn't like though. The wire around your neck seems odd. While I squat, bench press, run and do lat pull downs I noticed the wire moves around a lot. Sometimes twisting up, then I had to take one ear piece off and re-adjust the wire. I did use the supplied cord management clip and shirt clip. It didn't help with the cord moving around. I think it's because the weight of the volume box pulls down more on one side.  I also noticed static noise while jolting up from the bench press laying position to a seated position. This has only happened twice.  Overall I do think they're worth the $39.99 I paid. They're currently listed at $32.99 as of 9/15/17. So they're even more worth it. But it's kinda a bummer to people that paid more 2 weeks ago."

I do not like that when answering phone calls, only the right ear is in use. I feel like the standard for 2018 is both ears working. There's a lag in the audio when watching videos which makes it impossible to watch. And when I run, the left ear connects and disconnects over and over again. For one of the more expensive sport wireless on the market Bose has really fallen short and not delivered with these. It's time to head back to the drawing board, and give it another try."

They fold up small and are easy to carry in a backpack, holding up well to pretty tough treatment. The battery lasts forever and if it does die, you can get a whole study session of juice for like 5 minutes of charging. Connecting to my MacBook, iPhone, or iPad is so easy using the M1 chip and the syncing of settings through iCloud that it makes connecting other bluetooth devices seem super cumbersome: Just turn the Solo3 and choose it from your list of devices (no need to disconnect from one device before connecting to the next). And finally, they look good and are very comfortable.So even though they aren't the best headphones I own, they end up being the ones I use the most because of how convenient, tough, long-lasting, and easy they are. Even though I said the sound isn't the best, the sound is great. The only time that I can discern that they are inferior is head-to-head, and even then, for some types of music these are preferred. They are certainly tuned to handle bass quite well, but they aren't overly bass-heavy as some other reviews indicate. So the sound is more than passable, quite good, and even superior for some music."

I am glad I did - great price, great sound (my opinion, but I am not a speaker snob), and the speaker works great.

In the way they are constructed from their own website they have the right bud as a master that repeats the signal to the left one (the slave).  For this the left left bud loses signal all the time and stops all sound every 2 or 3 minutes.  On mine the right one disconects every 20 minutes.  I checked on the bose website and there are lots of people having the same problems.  They only replied once and only said that the causeof the problem was the way the were made and no solution to fix the problem.  Im returning them as the cheap ones I bought for 20 dollars works better and do not loose conection. I still cant belive that I spent 200$ on a pair of headphones that are not suposed to work.  The problem is so persistent that it is imposible they did not found it while doing the quality check.  Im seriously thinking on not buying another Bose product after this one.

The first pair I ordered came with a case, extra ear buds, a short usb charging cable, a long usb charging cable with an adapter for USB C on the end, and a car charger. The second pair came with a short usb charging cable, and a magnetic phone holder that was missing parts. The case for the second one also reeked of stale cigarette smoke, as did the headphones themselves. It took about two weeks for the headphones to stop stinking. The case was simply a matter of spraying it with Febreze until it didn't reek anymore.While I am disappointed with the different items included with the second set I ordered, and with the stink of cigarette smoke, the headphones themselves are good enough to warrant only taking one star away."

For example I was using an angle grinder to grind some 1/4??? steel plate while I was on the phone, and the person on the other end could barely notice. Dead serious. They don???t do real well with blocking wind noise, but neither do any others. On windy days I drop the mic side into the neck of my shirt a little and problem solved.

I???m comparing mostly to LG HBS850.The first thing I noticed was how big the ear pieces are. They are pretty large and protrude out of your ears quite a bit. The LG ear piece is tiny in comparison(see image). I thought there would be no way the things were staying in my ears, however, they are MUCH more comfortable than the LG ear pieces. I didn???t even realize how uncomfortable the LGs were. The Bose ear piece doesn???t actually go inside your ear canal like the LG does.  With this type of earpiece, the Bose is not quite noise canceling(nor is it supposed to be).Some of the reviews say the Bose don???t get loud enough. Since they don???t actually go inside the ear canal and create a seal like the LGs and other internal earbuds do, it does seem like they don???t get quite as loud, however, they do get plenty loud. They just don???t get so loud that it hurts. If you want that, youu probably should go with the Beats.They connected to my iPhone 7 effortlessly. A mere click( we???ll more of a mushy push) of the power button and voila there it was on my phone.Then came the sound test. Oh my goodness!! They sound amazing. I can???t believe the difference in the sound quality between these and the LGs.It???s like the difference in monaural and stereophonic sound. The bass is very strong. I???m no techy person so I can???t really go into detail about how great the sound is but it is amazing.So that???s about all I can say for now.

Its an office environment, but no partitions and everything is wide open, so phone conversations and general noise carry all over.  I purchased a pair of Samsung noise cancelling headphones in August 2017 and those helped some.  We get $250 a year to purchase products for office use (keyboards, mouse, chair, books, training tools, etc...), so I decided for 2018 to get a higher end pair of noise cancelling headphones.  The Bose QuietComfort 25 seemed to be exactly what I was looking for and priced at $180 on Amazon.  These headphones are beyond what I thought they would be!  Just putting them on reduces much of the noise, except for higher pitched sounds.  If you put them on and play music or podcasts, it helps drown out more sound.  Finally, if you switch on the powered noise cancelling...watch out!  I've had a few occasions where someone has walked up to my desk and I can't hear them trying to get my attention.  In other words, they work PERFECT!!!  There are a couple, minor drawbacks.  The cord is kind of annoying when when everything else at your desk is wireless.  When you switch on the active/powered noise cancelling, you get the sensation of a pressure change in your ears.  It doesn't bother me too much, but the initial effect is noticeable.  Lastly, they are kind of big and bulky with no readily available color choices, unless you want to pay more.  Pay more just for a different color???  Other than that though, I am really enjoying my new Bose QuietComfort 25 Acoustic Noise Cancelling headphones.  I just put them on and all of the annoying conversations, office music, desk music and general distractions disappear!"

The headphones completely stopped charging/ turning on after several months.  The company replaced the headphones which was great except the replacement pair ALSO stopped working.  I have literally owned two pairs of these headphones, both with light use and no excessive wear and tear and both times have failed under 6 months.  The company did not agree to replace the second pair which shows that they do not stand by their product.  It is safe to say this product is a piece of junk that will most likely fail after several months as I have experienced.  If you like the price, remember this is more of a rental price than a purchase because you WILL be buying a new pair.  I highly recommend shelling out a few more bucks for a more reputable product.

A couple things I want to bring up, but overall so far, so good.  I bought these primarily because I wanted a different set of earbuds than my apple ones for listening to music while working out, which I am trying to do more regularly.  My ultimate goal is getting some music onto my ticwatch E and listening straight from the watch, but I haven't done that yet.  I have noticed a few things that could use some improvement, though I'm not sure how you can tackle this.1) The earbuds seem to stay in the ear just fine with the wings, and I am using the smaller tips.  However, if you push them in too much, the music sounds like it's cutting in and out because of your body moving up and down, etc.  That's annoying however if you pull the tips out from the ear canal a little bit, it seems to be much better.  I would just continue to work on testing that out and seeing what ear tips, wings, materials combination of creating a good seal while moving and that it has no impact on the sound while working out, running, walking, etc.2) The quality of the sound is pretty good overall!  The clarity of the highs is good, however I would love more bass (but that's just me).3) The length of the charging cable is too short.  Would love a longer length!That's about it for now! Thank you for producing a great product so far!"

295948,133,AMIT,positive,negative,Not discussed,Not discussed,Not discussed,positive,Not discussed,positive,Not discussed,Not discussed,"So far I like the headphones. I noticed the SOUND QUALITY is better using Bluetooth when connected to your phone as opposed to using the cable that comes with the headphones. However, the opposite is true when plugging the headphones into my computer (2011 macbook pro). The volume is louder and the sound is crisp (in my opinion).Because I've read reviews about the issues of quality with the build, I've been treating them with care as I don't want to break the swivel part but so far, I haven't had any issues and I plan to keep it that way.They can block the noise of the outside when the volume is up close to max but they don't cancel noise when listening at regular volume. This is not bad at all but if you want to cancel noise, it won't happen. Again, that's not really a bad thing and the sound is still very good. Spacial awareness over blasting music is what I say!CONNECTING to the device was simple to start and I've connected my ipod and computer to it pretty easily. The only thing I don't like (not a deal breaker by far) is connecting back to the headphones. What i mean by this is if I play music from my ipod I can connect my phone by clicking on the bluetooth device in my settings BUT it only connects for calls and not music so I have to tap my phone to the headphones to connect via NFC and then I am fully connected. Other than that, everything is good and I am planning on buying a hard shell carrying case to further protect my investment.I purchased these because a classmate of mine let me try them and the sound was lovely plus she had them for 3 years and said she's had no issues. every time we have class she is wearing them so that was enough for me to hear."

I will admit that this is my first set of Bluetooth earbuds/headphones as I've always been a wired guy myself, but the convenience of not having to snake a wire under my shirt at the gym anymore is worth it enough. The fit is nice for my ears, and I RARELY purchase in-ear headphones due to the fact that I start getting ear pain after 10 minutes from anything that doesn't have the Bose ear-tips.The sound quality is quite acceptable, but they are not forgiving. They rely on creating a full seal inside your ear to achieve a nice bass, this is great for the music but could be dangerous for outdoor activities as they almost completely block outside noise. If you're using these in a gym though, they are great because, well, they block out all the noise. If there is not a perfect seal with these, the sound will be treble-heavy, and quiet. Luckily Anker provides several ear-tips to get a solid fit. Try them all, it will save you a lot of frustration of stopping mid-workout to re-seat them.Battery life is still being tested, but initial impressions are great! I've used these for about 3 hours at the gym for 30-45 minutes a session and I have not had to recharge the battery. I topped them off for a business trip I was going on, and the passive sound isolation worked wonders on the plane.I tend to sweat when I work out, and these have shown no signs of quitting on me. Other than the cord sometimes rubbing against my shirt, and causing some vibration noise, I wouldn't recommend anything else, and when (if?) these die for good, I will certainly get another pair."

Couldn't really find a downside but I guess if your a huge audiophile you might want to have a more dominant bass. Don't get me wrong the bass is above average but where these really excel is the balance and clarity of the sound.  I have gone back and listened to a lot of music, podcasts, random videos and you can really pick up on the very faint intricacies of what your listening to.  In my opinion the noise canceling feature should always be turned on because in addition to doing its job very well it increases the quality of sound.

They don't have the refinement I'd expect from higher priced alternatives, but they do the job and are a great upgrade for someone looking for a little virtual isolation in a loud-ish work space.Pro:Good sound quality. Coming up from some pretty cheap gear, this are definitely in a better tier of quality. I'm not huge on bass, but these have a strong bass presence I don't find overwhelming.Decent passive noise reduction - blocks white noise well, and makes it easy to ignore nearby office chatter.The mechanism for folding in the cups is easy and feels like it won't wear out easily.One-button-hold for on/off/pairing was intuitiveNo issues with battery life so farNeutral:Plugging in the audio cable instantly powers them off - preserving battery but limiting featuresCon:Pressure on the ears - I have a large head and large ears, and it's tricky to get these to set so that they're not irritating my ears after a short time.  The description acknowledges you should take them off every couple hours, but I often have to adjust them repeatedly just a few minutes in to find the right angle.Volume controls - dual purpose track change/volume buttons haven't given me the best experience, unintentionally changing tracks or starting over. Volume adjusts in steps that are too large for my preferences, so I'm often left wanting to be halfway between two selectable levels (including when using the paired devices audio up/down buttons).Microphone - might work well in a quiet space, but mild background white noise in my office after everyone was gone (computer fans from other desks) made my caller think I was driving on speakerphone.

But moreover, allows you to choose which end the volume control button is on. Closer to the device, or closer to your head. We prefer it closer to the device, actually, so this is the first pair of headphones we???ve had where we can do that.The cord itself is also not the typical plasticky, smooth texture. It???s a braided cord, and is soft and flexible, and pretty long, too.The earpieces are comfortable to wear, and they block enough sound to help but not so much that you can???t hear anything happening around you.

First of all I do a lot of long haul plane trips. For the longest time I was jealous of all of these road warriors wearing their headphones with the Bose logo. I decided to do a decide between Bose and Sony. Yes the Sony headphones get warm and the Bose not so much. But the Sony sound is really beautiful compared to Bose. Bose sounds very flat and despite using and equalizer enhancement it offered no help. If you just want NC it might be cheaper to buy some Hearos but if you like good representive music with reasonable NC get the Sony.

I unfortunately didn't listen to them because there so many other reviews that praise everything about these headphones!Here's the simple truth: These headphones, though an amazing ""value"", simply do not measure up in the sound quality department, which I kind of feel is the most important one. The bass is way too amped up and overpowering (not in a good way), the mids are muffled and the overall clarity of sound is pretty poor.I've had these headphones for about six months, but the poor sound quality was immediately apparent. Yes, you can adjust the sound with your phones EQ to reduce the bass and it will improve things somewhat, but they still won't sound that good. Plus, anytime you listen to your phone in your car or on any other device, the sound will be all out of whack unless you go back into settings and readjust everything.This is like buying a smartphone that has long list of impressive features, but can't actually make a phone call. Yes, it still has value because of the many other features it provides, but the most essential one you bought it for is terrible. If you think about it, it just doesn't make sense!The other glaring problem is the annoying amount of whistling and wind noise I hear while jogging, even at a very slow pace on completely still days. This is something I've never experience with any other set of earbuds I've run with. The shape of these Sensos is not very streamlined with the sides of the headphones sticking out a good bit from your ears. I have noticed if I turn my head to the side while running, the wind noise is reduced quite a bit. However, running with your head turned to the side is a not a solution.Besides these two problems, these are really a great set of headphones. Good build quality, battery life, and value for the money.However, if you care at all about the quality of your sound experience while working out, then I would look elsewhere."

Personally i find it to be way to bass driven and not enough highs or mids present.Construction- biggest grips here are the large circles before the rubber ear drum inserts and the ear hooks.  The circle part seems to be fairly big and gets in the way of securely fitting in your ear canal. Maybe its just my ears but i have problems getting them in place and staying in place. Takes some fiddling around with these things in order for them to seat right. The ear hooks on these things are my next complaint since they are about worthless, hate to be harsh here but its the truth. They are super flimsy and offer no rigidity at all for support to the ear bud itself. Now they are super soft rubber which is awesome as they cause no irritation what so ever. Easy fix here is to have a piece of fairly rigid plastic be the ear hook backbone and dip or wrap it in the rubber they currently use.Microphone while in a call- Had multiple people tell me that it was hard to hear me while using these for a call. I had to speak loudly and speak super clear in order for the person on the other end to hear me well.Battery life is pretty solid on these things and meets the time listed in specs when brand new and fully charged.Overall I will be returning these due to fitment just being to much of a pain and the audio being way to heavy on bass for me."

The first pair were from Jaybird and these Bose headphones are much better.  Better sound quality.  Louder.  Battery lasts much longer.  I was a little worried when I bought them about the size of the ear pieces but it is not a problem at all.  Although they are significantly larger than the Jaybird's they actually fit my ear better, isolate background noise better, and are more comfortable.  They are amazingly light and you can't really tell you are wearing them.  Pairing works perfectly.  You can pair with multiple devices at the same time.  At the gym I watch videos on my iPad but can still receive calls on my iPhone.  I have also started using them as a headset for video-conference calls on my laptop and they are fantastic - better than my old USB headset.  I don't normally spend time writing reviews on Amazon but these things are so good I thought I would.  Well done Bose."

They sound good, I love the flat wire (helps avoid tangling), I love the L headphone plug, and the noise isolation isn't bad, and I love that they have a microphone without having other things like volume control and other things like that which make the cord a bit too heavy jerk around a lot if you're running. So all of the features I want in headphones are there, and I love that because it's difficult to find all of those things in 1 set of headphones... especially if you're trying not to spend a fortune.However, the one downside to these headphones which is really unfortunate, is that they really start to hurt if I wear them for more than an hour or so. I think it's just something about the design of the earbud connecting pieces.  They're designed to allow the headphones to go in at an angle. Personally I wonder if that feature is a bit of a gimmick as I've had both the straight ones and the angles ones, and neither make much of a difference to me. But regardless of whether it's a gimmick or not, this particular pair, the way they designed that part, it's either too big or at a weird angle... i don't know, but it makes my ears ache after an hour or so.I'll keep them to use for work calls, but for listening to music I need something more comfortable. I love the comfort of the for sennheiser earbuds, but one model with the microphone is like $100 (too much for earbuds which seem to rarely last 2 years regardless of the brand), and the cheaper model has a big bulky microphone.  I guess the search for the perfect earbud headphones continues."

The noise cancellation is uncanny good; the Quietcomforts can't compare to a fresh-calibrated 1000XM2 (you can update the NC anytime you like, its kinda fast and whoa, effective - scary effective).My comments for Sony:1. Cmon drop this incredible inept headphone naming algorithm - the WH1000XM2, seriously??2. Fix the sometimes-wonky song advance bug. No swiping, Swiper! It doesn't always work (why is this?). How about a real button for the fake swiping.3. Keep the awesome NC but really, really fix the faccid sound. Do this. Compare the Beats to the M2's. Somehow the Beats lets you hear sounds and tones that the M2 cannot.4. Make the two buttons a little more pronounced  - hard to find them at times. Too close together as well.

Oh and it all comes with a vehicle USB charger and carry case. I needed the small buds and with the dongle on the cable adjusted to fit around my neck they were much more stable while running. Not the most comfortable I've ever worn but these are half the price too. Sound is perfectly adequate for their price point and purpose, plenty of volume but don't drown out sounds around me.

Unfortunately, the overall performance is not as great as the sound. I use the headphones predominately with my FiiO X3 Bluetooth Music Player while I work out at the gym. Every time I turn on the headphones, I get the pairing then connected messages but no sound. I have to turn off then turn on the Bluetooth setting on the music player. The headphones pair then connect and I get music. I have to go through this process every time I use the headphones-very frustrating. In addition, the music skips for a second intermittently. I contacted the company to request an exchange for another unit. The company declined my request stating the 90-day return window closed. The company also stated that the process of turning my music player Bluetooth setting on and off is required since the headphones can be connected to other devices. I do not have to go through this off and on process with my MPow H5 Bluetooth headphones. Once my MPow headphones are connected to my music player, they connect automatically the next time and every time after that until I switch to another Bluetooth device on the music player. The Paaw headphones have a much better sound than my MPow headphones but the MPow performance is much better. The Paaw representative also theorized that the intermittent skips are probably the music players fault. This theory is not valid since the player does not skip when the MPow headphones are connected. I understand that the return window is closed but isn???t there a warranty period? Doesn???t Paww stand behind their products?"

Sound fidelity is alright, a little fuzzy or tinny, and the bass is a lacking. Audio cord is too short for anything other than working at your laptop. But for regular office use, these things seem ideal.The built-in mic is spotty at best. Granted, I was outside with a slight breeze, but it's like you need to shout for it to register you at all.

Attempting to wear these for more than 30 minutes or so gives me a headache, and bends the hell out of my ears. That being said, the sound quality was fairly decent, especially for the cost, and it has a pretty powerful bluetooth radio on it (Better range than my Rowkin earbuds, or a wireless bluetooth speaker I have). I also originally bought these as a backup microphone/headset combo, unfortunately they arrived with no microphone boom either. There is a small hole labeled ""mic"", but if you try to use it as a microphone to talk with it will sound like you are in the bottom of a well and whispering. Returning today."

280171,117,Akshay,positive,positive,positive,Not discussed,Not discussed,Not discussed,positive,positive,positive,Not discussed,"I own both a pair of Cowin E7 and E7 Pro headphones and have been very pleased with the sound, quality, and price.  Let's start with the physical aspects of the two headsets.The E7 Pro weighs in at an 11 ounces, one ounce heavier than the E7.  Both units look to be the same dimensions and style.  The E7 Pro has some metallic flare on the outside of the earpieces to give it a little pizzaz over the E7.  These are going to be larger than any on the ear style headphones you may consider but are so much more comfortable if you plan to wear them for an extended period of time.  The E7 Pro comes with upgraded Ear Cushions.  They have a bit more spring than that of the E7, but both are perfectly comfortable and I have never had to ""break them in"" as with other headsets.  The E7 Pro came with a nice carrying case that I had to purchase separately with the E7.  I think the case is a must if you are traveling, but you may not care.Noise Cancelling - The noise canceling feature on both sets are amazing.  It is almost too good where you might feel slightly disorientated when you first use them.  That took me about an hour of usage for me to adjust.  The good news, if you don't like it, you can turn off this feature.  I have used these on a plane and could tune out the plane noise AND the unhappy toddlers with no issues.  I can listen to the softest sounds while using my lawn equipment.Buttons - I have not had good luck with the controls on either headset and have found it much more convenient to make the volume and track adjustments on my iPhone than fiddling with the buttons.  This is easy when you have the phone readily accessible.  This may be that I am impatient to practice and figure out the buttons.Sound -  I am not an audiophile.  I know how I like things to sound and gauge based on that.  The E7 was my first Cowin purchase and I was amazed at the sound.  The E7 Pros are listed to have ""Much Better Sound"", I figured it might only be hype.  To my surprise, there was a noticeable difference in music.  I listened to some of my favorite songs on both back to back and do prefer the sound produced by the E7 Pros. I didn't see much difference between the headsets when listening to audiobooks.  With that said, I would have been just as happy with my E7 had I never known the E7 Pro existed.Battery -  I used the E7 on two extended plane rides a week apart and never had to charge the unit.  I think in the months that I have used them, I have probably charged them once a month.  The E7 Pros arrived and I was a bit too excited to charge them as the manufacturer would probably suggest.  I have used them for 12 hours straight with no issue.  Amazing!Bluetooth connection - The E7 Pro seems to have a stronger connection.  I usually keep my phone on my left side and my body seemed to cause occasional interference with the E7 Model.  The E7 Pro doesn't seem to have this problem.  Truly not a big deal, but if this small detail would be a frustration for you, maybe consider the Pro first.Mic- I have never either headphone for a phone call so I can not attest to the feature.I have been very pleased with the Cowin product and will try venturing out into more of their product line!"

I've used one pair of these for over 3 years as my workout headphones. These have survived probably 1000 workouts and have performed flawlessly. As a note I wear these on the inside of the back of my shirt and keep my phone I my pocket while lifting so these (at least the wires) have seen a considerable amount of moisture. I will take them out of my ears and let them hang over my shoulder on the outside of my shirt too. This can lead to the actual ear buds to be soaked when leaning over the water fountain. But they have not been phased by it. I am still using the original rubber boots, or whatever you call them too. I prefer to use a size larger than what really fits just to ensure a good deal on my ear to get the full effect of the sound quality. They are soft enough to not begin to hurt my ears after 3 hours.A note on sound quality. I've own several different brands of earbuds over my years; from the first edition of the Bose ear buds to everything you can find on the shelf of your local store. These have been the cheapest and most durable with sound that matches the best of any others.A few days ago one earbud just died. I took it apart and couldn't find anything wrong with it but it was still disappointing. Then I remembered how long I've been thrashing on them and they're cheaper than a fast food meal.I ordered a few more sets with a few stores for a rainy day when I lose or forget them."

They should be much easier.3- When connected to my PC they are only picking up Mono, not stereo...what the heck? who wants to use one bud only?

One day I put my ear buds in my pocket, and a while later took them out, tapped on the button on the right earbud and heard it say ""connected to [device name]"" and started only hearing music playing from the right earbud. I then realized after inspecting the left earbud that it has it's own button (hard to see as it doesn't have the audio controls) and soon realized that each bud turns on/off independently. This is made more confusing because when I take the earbuds out of the case, both earbuds automatically turn on, but when it goes to sleep outside of the case, you have to manually turn them both on. My guess is some of the people who have sound only coming from one side just missed the button on the left earbud."

I was very pleasantly surprised at the high quality of the Paww headphones.  They were simple to pair with my phone, comfortable to wear all day and provided excellent sound quality.  I listen to classical music and the sound quality was wonderful. Perhaps most importantly, they greatly minimized the noise on the plane which made for a far more enjoyable day of travel.

Even after leaving it at a full charge over night, when I remove them from the charger, it says I have a charge of 90%. I just removed them from the charger after 7-10 hours. Another really annoying feature is when you are listening to anything, the automatic voice will chime in to let you know you've connected to another device -- or has disconnected.

These headphones have EARNED my VERY GOOD review!First off, as most people will say, they are an excellent investment for the price. Overall, the look, quality of build, sound, battery, comfort, etc all met or far exceeded my expectations.The battery is probably the best feature. I got mine delivered at the end of April 2018 and JUST NOW (September 1, 2018) needed to charge them. AMAZING! Granted, I only use them when I am doing something art related or playing video games but that can be an average of about an hour or two every night. So the battery is 5 stars without question.The comfort level of the ear pads are 5 stars as well. They are not too bulky and feel super soft and retain their original shape after taking them off. I have had BEATS in the past as well and I am not really one for Apple products as a whole. Definitely one-up on BEATS on-ear models. I would wear my beats and my ears would hurt after 30 minutes. Not a problem here.The construction is very nice. I love the weight and the matte finish. The reviews that you read about these headphones being cheaply made are of no concern. I think you'll find that most people who are always complaining that things are cheaply made or always breaking on them are the types of people who don't know how to take basic care of nice things. Just sayin'. If you don't want them to break or snap or short out when they get wet, then don't give them to your 2-year-old to play with, don't wear them in the rain, and basically don't handle them like an newborn ape! Or at least explain why they broke rather than say ""THAY CRACKED AN THAY SUK!""The sound quality is great. These are a nice compromise to BEATS and definitely win over them in a lot of aspects. I will say thought that I can understand how people say the BASS switch makes them seem like the loud cars that pass your house late at night with their stereos rumbling the windows of every house on the block! These guys really rumble. BUT...I will say this. I listen to many different types of music (metal, rap, jazz, NOT country, etc.) They really affect different types of music different ways, WHICH IS COOL. ""The power is YOURS"" -Captain Planet. I was expecting to listen to Metallica's album ""...And Justice For All"" and hear a clear bass that has been missing. That was not the case. I was a little disappointed there. But when I listened to Mastodon's album Leviathan, specifically the song ""Blood and Thunder"" it really helped bring some beautiful color to the drums. LOVED IT. If you are not a metal fan, listen to something you like. Mess with the volume and the bass. You'll find that doesn't really do anything for classical music but the drums, or beats, on something drum or beat driven can really be manipulated alot better. That is definitely something that BEATS DO NOT HAVE! Plus, if you like gaming (ie. Battlefield, COD, etc) the gunshots and sounds or war really sound real!I hope you have learned alot and enjoyed my guided tour of the Skullcandy Crusher Headphones from a standard consumer's viewpoint. All in all, return them if you think I'm wrong. Do you, dude! but you won't be disappointed if you have heeded my words! Go for it! Buy 'em! Do it! DO IT NOW!"

I read all the reviews which prompted me to purchase this set.  initial use I found the headset lacked bass response. I contacted the company and they asked me to do a reset.  The reset seemed to address the bass somewhat to an acceptable level.  I tried using these in the evening to sleep with and found that the blue blinking power light was bright enough to notice it in a darkened room.  The only workaround I discovered was got place a small piece of electrical tape over this light. The final issue that forced me to return these was that several times after powering these onI would press the play button on the headset and the music would simple come out of the iPhone and not the headset.  The headset buttons were controlling the volume and pause the music coming out of the iphone speaker no sound was coming out of the headset.

286996,123,Akshay,positive,positive,positive,Not discussed,Not discussed,Not discussed,neutral,Not discussed,Not discussed,positive,"These headphones will not disappoint. They are packed with great features including a touch sensitive controller on the right outer ear casing that lets you play, pause, raise/lower volume, activate voice command (Google / Siri), along with an innovative feature that allows you to hear what's around you by placing your hand on the right casing which stops noise cancellation and activates the external microphone. This allows you to hear someone talking to you without taking the headphones off. In terms of sound, you get super-crisp audio that can be EQ'ed using the free downloadable app. Right out of the box, the headphones sound a lot like Beats Audio headphones (which are slightly bass heavy and not to my liking) but by dropping the ""clear bass"" by -1 allows the clarity to shine through. If you are like me and not a fan of the muddy Beats Audio sound, dropping the clear bass will make these sound better than the Bose QC35ii which are great headphones. The noise cancelling is really good with only a very low audible hiss when no other sounds are being processed by the headphones. I spent a lot of time playing with the Bose QC35ii and the Sony WH1000xm2 headphones before making my decision. Both are great products but I feel the Sony with all of its available features and adjustable sound gave it the slight edge to make it worthy of my purchase decision.

Even with all the reviews and whatever little research you can do to find out as much about a certain product as you can, you will never know until you buy it and see it for yourself.  But with as many good enough reviews as this one had I couldn't ignore it.I recently returned two different bluetooth earbuds and decided to give this one a try.  And let me tell you now.  These have exceeded my expectations.The cable length isn't too long and still can be used without the cable manager but everyone's head is shaped differently and neck length is different so it's good to have one just in case.  I'm using it now and have found a sweet spot of what length to keep it at.  The ear hook is very comfortable and I prefer the foam tips and am very glad they had that option.The sound is superb and even when it might feel the earpiece is getting a little loose the sound never fades and the bass is still the same.  I'm a bass head and so the bass on these are more then ok.Build quality is really up there with the $100 plus earbuds and wouldn't be able to tell that these were under $50.Definitely sweat proof.  I haven't submerged them but I'll have to wait til that happens to see if they really are IPX7 as it describes.Perfect for the gym, running, working out in general.  I love that the controls are built into the earpiece.  I always had problems with the controls being on the cord because it always got in my face.  You don't have to worry about that with these.  buttons are placed conveniently all on the right earpiece for easy access.Calls were very clear on both ends.Overall these are a definite 10!!!"

I was surprised by the immense quality difference, because these are so cheap, costing less than $10.  The earpiece shape fits my ear more securely than my JVCs (which I also like) or my Taotronics, and they don't fall out easily when I walk or move around.

So As soon as I saw these Anker earbuds I ordered them right away for the gym, but I'm not too impressed by its volume. It has a moderate sound but it's not loud enough.

The bass is resonant, and music is clear, as far as I'm aware.The noise-cancellation, on the other hand, is fantastic. The best place to test these is on flights -- as soon as I wear these, I immediately fall asleep, comfortably listening to my music while barely (and I mean, barely) hearing the plane's engines. Thankfully due to new TSA regulations, you can now wear these during the entirety of your flight.The adjustable headband is comfortable, and can be easily be worn for long periods of time. While the weight may be of concern to some (196 g), I believe it is negligible enough and similar to its competitors.Overall, these are a great pair of headphones.

I'm 54 years old and have never had a customer service department react and fulfill a customer's needs as much as their department.  With that said, the headphones are extremely comfortable and very easy to wear.  The sound is very full with the highs and lows and has excellent base reflex. Not too much bass, like those sub woofers, just enough to make the music very full and rich.  The Mic works well, and I have used the headphones on several conversations, and everybody says they can hear me just fine.  In fact they usually hear whatever I'm doing in the background.  The ANC is good for the price point and filters out most of the background noise.  With that being said about the ANC, if you are wanting a really strong ANC, I would recommend the SE7 instead.  The price difference between the two units seems to be mostly used for the ANC. The battery is extremely strong and for me lasts all week long, and that's with me using it several days a week and for several hours at a time.  All in all these headphones are a perfect match for price and features."

304928,142,Priyanka Narula,positive,positive,positive,negative,Not discussed,Not discussed,negative,positive,positive,Not discussed,"So far so good.I bought it because I often forget taking earbuds on flights and have to buy them on flights which I quickly loose before my return trip! So I thought maybe carrying a sizeable wireless headphone will solve the problem considering the significant size.Additionally, it helps to watch and listen to TV program at home when others are doing their own thing without me distracting them.Pros:1.Sound quality is good.I like that the equalizer self adjusts to the sound continuously and you do not have to make any manual adjustment. The sound it delivers is undiluted. It is as rich as the sound coming out from our old Phillips surround speakers connected to an OPPO audio/video system.2.The cancellation effect is excellent.At a high level, it effectively cancels out all external ""noises"".  For safety reason, I use it on the low level so I can still be aware of my surrounding.3.It is very comfortable on my ears.I do not just place the ear piece over my ears .I deliberately make sure I place it over my ears coming from a back approach.That way the ear lobe sits into the recess and no pressure is applied on my ears.Then I push the piece up but not pull it down as one would normally do.Compared to prior headphones I had worn many years back for listening to music, my ears do not get uncomfortably warm after a prolong use, by prolong use, I mean wearing it for 20 minutes or more.I have worn this headphones for 5 hours continuously without feeling any discomfort of warmth or pressure to my ears.4.Have not tested the limit  of the battery life.But as noted above, it has  served me for 5 hours of continuous use.Also,I make sure I charge it after each use. I believe that the battery life will even be longer than it is today.5.The unit is not heavy to carry but I think that as the technology improves that lighter materials will be used to make it lighter. I have not tried using it to make hand free calls with my phone.Other reviewers say that, that feature works well.6.Reconnecting to any bluetooth devise automatically has always been smooth and seamless. Has excellent memory. Have not tried other brands to compare with, I doubt I can afford to do that.I am happy with this wireless headphone and will recommend it.Cons:1. Expensive.2.The manual that came with it was not very helpful.My wishes:1.That the system automatically shut itself off after 20 seconds of being taken off from the ears, if it does not detect any pressure from the ear pieces.This will save the battery life.2.That it has a storage compartment in it you can store the wired cable.3.That it comes with an ""instructive"" instruction manual. I had to go online to download a manual that made more sense.4.That I do not have to take it off my ears to listen to someone talking to me. Planatronics unit I have read has a feature to overcome this little incovenience. By placing your palm over the right ear piece makes you hear external sound and temporarily pauses the internal sound.Removing your palm, resumes the internal sound and cancels out the unwanted external source of sound.Boss could learn a thing from Planatronics here."

Other less important issues: they talk too much! when turning on to pick up a call, it says several words which means you can't hear the other person, rubber cover on the volume switch popped off and can't fix, pulse isn't taken unless the app is open and active which means no analytics/graphs - you have to be looking at the app to get info - no ability to set a target HB range while exercising.

After going through a couple pair of Bose Soundsport and Beats Solo 3 workout earbuds, sound quality wise these are right up there. The sound control on the right side can be both a little finicky and heavy, wanting to bounce away after a while of use. The battery also does not quite last as long as the later products as I need to recharge after every 4-5 uses. But for the price, you are getting a surprisingly decent product for a fraction of the cost as the name brand workout earbuds."

They sound better than my Jaybirds BlueBuds X and my old wired pair of Bose headphones. They are SUPER comfortable. Easy to use. They're super light in my ear and I never worry about them falling out. The SoundTrue tips from my old Bose headphones fit and worked perfectly, but made the sound a bit tinny, which is fine because I found these new SoundSport tips that came with the headphones to be more comfortable and sound better, but they do block out more noise. They aren't noise cancelling but don't expect to be able to have a conversation while wearing these. The wire is a bit thin so time will tell how it'll be hold up to wear and tear, and the volume/play buttons are a bit mushy, which isn't a complaint, I just prefer something more clicky. I'm guessing it's mushy because it's rubber for the water resistance. My biggest complaint, which is still a small one, is that the 6 hour battery life seems a bit short. They probably would've had to do something like the LG Tones do for more battery, so I'm okay with how they did it.All in all, I'm VERY happy with these. The thing that matters most is that they sound good, and they sound amazing."

295678,132,Priyanka Narula,Not discussed,Not discussed,Not discussed,Not discussed,Not discussed,negative,positive,neutral,Not discussed,Not discussed,"So let me say these are fantastic earphones, but a terrible wireless.  I've owned lots of headphones over the years from studio cans, to high end Bluetooth, to Hifi systems.  Let me say I am the kind of guy who is very particular about the quality of their music.So let me say these headphones are quite solid.  They are not the best I have ever heard, but I will give these a thumbs up.  When one considers they are budget priced earbuds they are very good for casual listening, such as when exercising, or in my case doing yardwork.  They paired easy, fit great, and were simple to use.  I am pairing these to a Galaxy Note 5.  The APT-X codec means you get get quality sound without the bass being dropped out like with many budget BT phones.The problem?  I know the antenna is in the little control pod on the left earbud's side of the wire.  How do I know this?  Because they cut out *Constantly* when using them outside.  If any part of my body covers this pod these cut out.  Why outside?  Well because inside the BT radio signal from your phone bounces off everything close to you.  Outside in open space these cannot rely on that crutch.  The antenna is too weak to pick up the signal though my own body.  In my pocket, with the wire around the back of my neck the pod sits on top of my shoulder.  My chest/torso might as well be solid lead as far as these are concerned.  I fact its so bad I can put my hand around the pod and these cut out completely and lose connection.This is rather poor because I have used can style BT phones that work 30 feet away though 4 walls even metal objects.  These cannot cover 2.8 feet and a portion of my wet sack of meat.  That makes these a no-go for me since I can't pocket my phone outdoors, that is objectively worse than dealing with a wire."

303669,140,SIDAK,neutral,positive,Not discussed,positive,Not discussed,Not discussed,Not discussed,positive,Not discussed,Not discussed,"First things first, with the bad:Smell. There is a smell that wafts around the headphones. Personally, for me, it is not a problem, and it shouldn't be for you unless you're a wuss, and the smell disappeared completely after a few days anyways.Ear cup gloss. Wow, the ear cups are SHINY. It's that annoying shiny plastic that looks really good for the first five seconds that it's untouched, and then fingerprints happen and it's all smudged. I used a scotchbrite pad to rub it off and also try to make that brushed aluminum texture, but it didn't work out as well as I thought. If you don't like shiny smudged stuff, then you might have a problem with these.Lastly, CONSTRUCTION. Mine has cracks in the headband. I repeat, CRACKS. It has literally been less than two weeks since I received these, and I know for a fact that I've never abusively used these. I'm mostly upset about the crack, because while I do not abuse my headphones, I use them extensively, meaning the crack is inevitably going to spread. And after removing the gloss from the headband I don't even know if I can get a refund or not, and returning is always a hassle. The crack is shown in the picture. Small, but I bet you 20 sets of these phones that it'll spread.There are some good points to these.Sound quality is good, but I'm not an audiophile, so don't take my word for it. I literally class any sound that sounds ""nice"" as good. I will say though that with the ANC on, the sound quality becomes louder, and... crisper? I recommend listening with the ANC on.The plastic feels nice and looks nice. It's just that now cracks are appearing that I'm starting to have doubts. Ear cups and underside of headband are plush and soft.ANC. Cuts off majority of airplane hum, so that's a plus in my book. There's a slight hiss when activated, but it becomes unnoticeable. Fellow humans cannot be blocked out.Overall, I would have given these a 5 for quality per price, but the cracks. The cracks. -3 stars right there. That's a serious killer right there, because I was expecting these to last for a while. They didn't even last two weeks, and I only just now noticed the crack. I literally rushed to the computer as soon as I saw it. Which means that it could have broken some other time in. Just waiting for that fateful day where a snapping sound will signal the sudden limpness of the phones around my ears.UPDATE 5/17/18: Patozan just gifted me with a brand new pair of these, which is really nice. I like these headphones a lot, and it was a shame to see my old pair get cracked. So I'm updating my rating of these back to 5 stars, hoping that it was just that one pair that was abnormally weak or something. I would give an extra star for these if I could just for the prompt customer service - they emailed me a day or two after my review went through. So fast!"

I would highly recommend them.Note to windows users. I don't know if you will have the problem I had but there is one setting you will want to change to make your connectivity better. You go to device manager then click on bluetooth. For me I had to find the highspeed adapter and right click to get to properties.

These folks are amazing.  I assume the seller is a small company, and they are truly on top of taking care of their customers.  I've had two issues with the headphones (I'll discuss in the product review below).  The first time, I emailed the seller on a Friday evening around 6pm.  I assumed I'd hear from them the following Monday after the weekend.  I was wrong.  They wrote me back at 8:30 that same evening.  They were able to fix my problem via emails and I was able to use the headphones that same evening.  The second time I had a problem I emailed them again.  It was on a Sunday at 5:42 p.m.  They wrote me back that same evening.  This time they weren't able to resolve my issue but promised to send me replacement headphones.  I received them two days later - on Tuesday.  That's incredible customer service, and these guys deserve five stars just for their dedication and responsiveness.Now on to the headphones review.  I'm a runner and I bought these specifically to use while running.  I haven't used them for telephone calls or any other purpose, so these comments are completely geared toward using these headphones to listen to music while exercising and running.  I've been using them for a little over a month.  First, the sound quality.  For the price ($37), I think they sound pretty good. I was a musician in a past life, and there are definitely headphones out there that sound better.  These are by no means ""studio quality,"" but they sound very good.  Some folks on here complained about the bass being a bit heavy, but I kind of like it.  I've used other headphones that have virtually no bass and sound very metallic.  These headphones are pretty well balanced.  And, as others have mentioned, you can download an equalizer app if you really want to dial them in and EQ down the bass.  But I think they sound more than good the way they are.  You won't get audiophile sound for $37 and if that's your goal, you're shopping down the wrong aisle.You can nitpick little things all you want with any product purchase, but for $37 and all the included features, these headphones are very decent and deserve all the great reviews.  For running, I wanted headphones that were ""sweatproof,"" wireless, loud and that would stay put in my ears while running.  These headphones are all those things.  With the hook design for the ears, they rarely move around in my ears, and I've had no issues with them having to be adjusted.  The wireless is great, and I've never had an issue with them connecting to my Samsung Galaxy S8 +.  They are also plenty loud.To alleviate and fears of those contemplating making this purchase, I'll address some of the complaints I've seen in other reviews.  Some mentioned that the power button is awkwardly placed in the middle of the right ear headphone and can get pushed accidentally while adjusting the headphone. This is true.  However, it seriously only took me maybe one outing to adjust to the power button placement, and it hasn't bothered me since.  Others think the ear hooks aren't comfortable - I think they're fine.  If you're going running, the hooks are awesome.  These headphones stay put and don't move around - all because of the hooks.  I used some other ""hookless"" headphones while running the other day, and every two minutes I had to adjust them - big pain in the butt.  I've also read some complaints about the wire sticking to your neck.  That did bother me the first few runs.  I don't think this problem is unique to these headphones.  I think any similar ""wireless"" headphones will have one wire between right and left sides and that wire has to be routed.  Regardless, I figured out to simply run the wire over the top of my head.  Since I always wear a hat when I run, the wire is now under my hat and not on my neck.  If you're not wearing a hat, I also think using some Body Glide or other similar product on the wire would solve the problem.  Lastly, battery life - very acceptable as far as I'm concerned.  I almost always charge them fully before I leave the house, and I've never had an issue.  They charge very quickly, so I keep them charged.  I know I can't outrun the battery on these, and that's good enough for me.  Other folks might be concerned whether these headphones will die after eight hours or after nine hours.  I will never run long enough in one outing to find that out, so not an issue for me.Lastly, let me mention the specific problems I have experienced with these headphone.  The first time I contacted the company, it was because sound was only coming out of the left side.  They suggested I perform a ""factory reset,"" which apparently can cure a number of oddities.  Sure enough, the factory reset fixed my sound problem and all was good.  So... if you're having any weird issues with your headphones, go for the f"

My only complaint is the right angle plug.The sound quality is wonderful for something in this price range. A little bassy, but no loss of resolution in the midst or highs. No crackle under high volume or wide spectrum sound. Like I am legitimately impressed. Going from my big Sony MDR v6 headphones I have at work to these when I work out isn't a jarring change in overall sound quality and dynamics.The fit is wonderful too. All my life I've avoided earpods because they don't stay in my ear, and they hurt after a while. These are not like anything else I've used. I don't know what it is, maybe the slight oval shape, or maybe the materials used. Even after a 2 hour workout, I hardly notice that I have them in.Isolation from outside sound is about the same as any other pair I've tried.I have 4 or 5 pairs of these now, stashed at home, at work, in the car, in case I ever forget them."

Not soon after my initial review, the MPow guys contacted me to address my concerns, which I didn't at first notice.  So fast forward a few months, I got an email from MPow, asking about the headphones again.  I was pleasantly surprised, because 1) I wasn't really angry about the headphone to begin with, and 2) They were awesome enough to offer me their updated headphones to try.  MPow really impressed me in that regard.  So two thumbs up to the MPow team.  By the way, the replacement headphone were very good, sounded great and the fit was top notch!Got this when they had a sale going on, thanks to Kinja Deals for the heads up.  The sound is good, quite surprising to me actually.  You'd understand when you get your hands on this.  It feels kind of light and unsubstantial, almost toy-like, but it works well for its purpose.  Wireless or corded (via its built-in headphone cable jack), the sound comes out neutral but good.  No bass whatsoever, but decent sound nonetheless.Would've given it four stars if not for the fit of the ear cups.  For this headphone, the width between the ear cups are wide and are very symmetrical.  Also, there is no give from the front/back orientation when I put them on.  On top of that, the ear cups are round as opposed to oval and too small to fit flush with my ears within it.  So all that mean is this thing feels awkward on my noggin.  I'm constantly trying to adjust to make it feel right.I only use it at work occasionally and I got it for a good price, so I'm not gonna knock it too much."

I used these for a full day of travel (from the east coast to Hawaii) and they are still going strong without needing to recharge. I am sure they might not have the sound quality of a Bose pair for everyday use but if you fly often, these really are phenomenal. I had a screaming baby in the row in front of me the whole flight and these puppies made it feel like I was sitting alone in my bedroom watching a movie. I was able to listen to music/watch movies without the engine noise or the terror toddler screams. I am also impressed with the quality and ease of use. They are a bit bulkier than other headphones but I don't mind it at all. I have no regrets at all with this purchase and I think I made a believer out of the random stranger I sat next to on the plane. Paired easily with both my iPhone and Kindle and I like how I have the option of a wire and airline adapter if needed. I rarely leave product feedback but I have enjoyed these so much, I felt I needed to share in case anyone was on the fence about purchasing. I have no complaints.

Pairing my iPhone is easy. My Dell pc had some difficulty to set up Blue tooth. However my primary reason for purchase was connecting Dell. It took me 2days to figure out. I found sound comes out of monitor HDMI connection but not headphone. All I had to do was on Windows blue tooth setting I remove monitor sound. Monitor display is not affected but sound is on MPOW.This made me very happy. Sadly I shipped it back after 4days on off switch became erratic and middle of  listening connects and disconnectsoften and too annoying. Sound quality was very good and I felt bad. I thought blue tooth was issue and connected wire to Dell PC then sound quality plummeted. It took 2wks before I gave up.

286258,123,Tanvi,positive,neutral,neutral,Not discussed,Not discussed,Not discussed,Not discussed,Not discussed,Not discussed,Not discussed,"I purchased both this and the Bose QuietComfort 35 Series II to compare the two. I liked that the Sony has an interactive app that shows me how it's calculating the noise cancelling (and it is noticeably improved after the calculation). The app also lets you choose different equalizer settings, including custom settings, which I like because I have hearing loss and I could customize it to my exact hearing needs. The controls are pretty slick, just swiping on the side of the earcup instead of hunting for a button. The sound quality of the music is excellent.However, here is why I ultimately chose the Bose, and it comes down to two things. Noise cancelling, and advanced sound processing. Re Noise cancellation, I recorded myself in the voice memo app on my phone using the both sets of headphones as the recording device. This simulates what someone would hear when I called them on the phone using the headphones. The noise cancelling in the Bose was excellent, and I only heard my voice. With the Sony, I could hear background noise. The Bose playback sounded like I was talking using a handset, and the Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone.The Bose iPhone app does not let you calculate anything, and it does not have an equalizer. At first this annoyed me, and then I realized that the Bose was calculating the levels for each song to produce the best sound, so I didn't have to use an equalizer.Also, when you're wearing the Sony, they are bulky and look geeky on. The Bose is more streamlined to the head. I personally find the Bose more comfortable on over glasses. The Sony seems to have some clamping to shut out the sound, and this is not comfortable over glasses. The Bose has very soft earcups and relies on the noise cancellation instead of physically clamping down on your ears."

Died today.... that is exactly less than 6 months of use.....Now the review...Pros: Incredible sound!, I bought these because I wanted to use for working out, I have a pair of apple AirBuds,  I did not want to lose them as they come out of my ear easily. I must say; these headphones have incredible sound, most inexpensive headsets you have to crank up the volume to get good quality sound. Well, you wont have to with these ones, lows are solid and mids and high are clear to the point that the volume can stay consistently in the mid range of the music and it will be pleasant whether you are running or at the gym or simply working with them.Cons: They died today... I have yet to put these thorough real hell, I am an avid runner and most of the time I run in dry weather, I do sweat, but no different than anyone who runs 5 miles at 8-9 minutes per mile.... For whatever reason, when I hit the 3 mile mark today they just stopped working and the blue light stayed on..like solid ON! I was not able to turn them on or off again... so I put them in my pocket and finished running... I placed them in my bag after getting ready and drove to work, just now as I type this review I am attempting to revive them and nothing... the light is now Solid RED! and they do not connect... SO I take they are finished... it is a shame that they did not even last 6 months...I guess is the last time I buy them"

I've had a pair last me about 3 years, and it is still working.  Only potential problems is that there are no inline controls or a microphone, and the plug is at a 90 degree angle, which may not work with some of th more bulky cases.  To fix both of these potential problems, I would recommend the Wotomic earhook headphones, which are only a few dollars more.  If you are not worried about either of those things, these are by far the best headphones for the best price you could possibly get."

292050,129,Shahrukh,neutral,Not discussed,positive,Not discussed,Not discussed,Not discussed,Not discussed,Not discussed,positive,Not discussed,"I've had these for a year now, and so I finally feel comfortable giving these a thorough review.I'll start off with the good:I feel like the battery life was excellently as advertised, and the packaging/supply of tips was up to Anker standards. I certainly have the impression that these are durable (hey, they've lasted a year) and the Bluetooth range was a solid 30ft or so. While sound quality is always dependent on the seal, I seemed to hear really muddled low ends that lacked a punch even when getting these perfectly situated. That said, I'd say the sound quality was a solid 4/5, especially considering the price. The aptX really shows its worth there.The bad, however:The buttons, while functional, always seem to be too heavy and pull towards the right side. (Oh, and you can expect that little round cable cinch that's supposed to keep the wire taut behind you to disappear within a few weeks or less.) You'd think this would be more of a problem while running (and it is), but I've constantly noticed myself having to adjust the cord while just walking around. And say if I was running, I'd have an even bigger, more annoying issue to deal with: the sound cuts out consistently with movement. This was especially problematic while trying to ride my bicycle, but it still happened to a lesser extent while just jogging. It's honestly the biggest reason I've stopped using these for exercise and probably what's helped them last so long. If I do decide to use these for mostly stational weightlifting, the earpieces don't seem to be very sweat-resistant either, which eventually  causes sound distortion and discomfort. Lastly, that hook around the ear is secure but can be very bothersome if you wear glasses while wearing these. The frame of your glasses always seems to want to be in the same spot that those hooks go and vice-versa. This actually caused quite a bit of lasting discomfort if worn for longer periods of time, which also contributed to my disuse of these.Overall, these are budget headphones that have decent sound and could be great for casual use. I use them every once in a while at the office, and they perform well there, especially considering the battery life. However, I have been fairly disappointed with their performance during physical activity and cannot recommend them for that purpose."

The noise cancellation is top of the line, although Sony XM2 is quite there too. I have used both, but keep coming back to this every time I have to stream a movie, you tube videos or use at work for extended periods of time. I know this is no audiophile equipment, and it is not quite comparable to the Sony XM2 in sound, but the overall usage experience is very satisfying. Bose is still the gold standard in noise cancellation and comfort.In terms of cons,  the app needs to catch up and introduce some new features. The addition of different noise cancellation levels is good but not enough. The Google assistant integration feels gimmicky, and I rarely use it. But I do appreciate Bose support releasing regular software updates to improve the overall experience."

Best fitting headphones I have ever worn, they stay in perfectly snug even while jogging and never try to loosen or fall out, and you don't hardly feel them in, just simply a perfect fit.2. Sound is very good, clear, crisp, nice tight full bass response, very true to how the music is supposed to sound.3. Angled headphone jack is great for preventing shorts.4. Light weight, which makes them very comfortable for running or just in general.5. At just over 6 dollars you can't find better quality and sound, period, these compete with headphones twice their price.Negatives:None.Extra info about sound, I have owned Sony super bass 14mm in-ear headphones, Iluv extra bass 14mm headphones, and several other headphones that came with my phone etc. If you are a person that has headphones just for Rap and want bass and don't care much about anything else then you may consider the Iluv headphones as an alternative, I own them and they have slightly larger drivers (14mm) so the low bass is a little better than these, not by much but it is better, the clarity and quality of sound isn't quite as good as these though so that is the trade off. Just wanted to mention that to help out the ones looking for that specifically in headphones, as those are the best value and quality for bass headphones that I have found so far."

Kz ate sport, Xiaomi mi Hybrids,and the Rock Zircon being my favorites. Xiaomi mi Hybrids were my favorite until I lost them, rock zircon second but the fit was just horrible. I would try different ear tips and I would have to constantly have to adjust the earphone in my right ear in order to have my ear pop in order to hear the music properly, and the kz ate claimed to have a lot of bass but really don't. These Sony earphones are awesome and have a little more bass than the xiaomi mi hybrids but handle the frequencies quite a bit better which I like since I listen to music with a lot of deep bass and I mean deep. The only problem I have is that the treble doesn't allow me to listen to these earphones at a comfortable volume to hear the bass at its best potential. If I turn the volume up, I can hear the bass nice and clear but the treble hurts my ears, if I turn it down, the treble isn't as harsh but i can't hear the bass as much as I would like. However, I just got them and they probably need to be burned in to maximize the amount of bass in the earphone but for now, I'm giving it a four star.

I previously bought a Beats earbuds which they are quite expensive ($199) and wanted to try them and see what was so special about them to be that pricey. Then a few days later I saw a promotion and product review for these AUKEY earbuds and they were available for $20. I decided to buy and try them too and compare them to the Beats ones. I noticed that AUKEY really held up very well and even sounded better than Beats. I like bass in my music and the bass in AUKEY is quite impressive! They have an equalizer to change the sound and bass settings to 3 different variations. The Beats ones just have one setting. I immediately returned the Beats expensive earbuds and kept the AUKEY and am glad I did. The only complaint I have for the AUKEY team is it would be nice to have earhooks to better secure the earbuds. They good noice canceling too
308606,145,AMIT,positive,Not discussed,positive,positive,Not discussed,positive,positive,Not discussed,Not discussed,negative,"My primary Bluetooth headphones are Parrot Zik 3.0, which are over the ear, wonderful, very expensive ($399) and not exactly sport around headphones.  I wanted some earbud style headphone for those times my big headphones wouldn't be the best option, like on long walks, at the beach or the gym. I also didn't want headphones tethered to each other by a cable.  So after much research and reading hundreds of reviews of multiple brands, I decided the ENACFIRE E18 seemed just perfect.I'm so glad I bought these.  They are incredibly comfortable (included are additional sized silicone ear tips to ensure a perfect fit) and the headphones simply ooze a quality feel.  I like that once you've powered them on, you don't have to touch them again to adjust volume.  You adjust the volume on your mobile device or laptop exclusively.  You can easily answer a phone call on the left earbud and the sound is quite good.  The true test of a headphone is how do they sound with music and the E18's deliver clear sound that doesn't disappoint.  Bass could be a bit more pronounced, but that's just the way it is with small earbuds.  Vocals and high frequencies are very natural and well balanced.  The pairing process is very simple and I have mine paired with not only my iPhone, but my laptop as well.The charging base the headphones sit in and get charged from seems really well made and has a nice solid feel.  When you get them, you need to remove a little sticky tab protecting the charging pins during travel.  When you insert them in the case, they click in magnetically and it just feels good doing so.  Even if you turn the charging case upside down, the earbuds stay snugly in place - Nice!  And as the manual suggests, the charging lights blink in succession from 4 rapid blinks to none in less than 2 hours.  The charging case will then recharge the E18s up to 4 times before you need to charge the charging base - Also Nice!  They're long lasting too as I've gotten at least 4 hours of continuous play in a single charge.  As long as you keep the charging case charged, it's nice to know you'll never reach for your headphones and find them out of charge.One thing that was confusing to me was the user guide which said once the charging base is fully charged, the blue LED will go out.  Mine didn't go out even after 8 hours.  I noticed from other reviews, theirs didn't either.  So I wrote the seller and they were very responsive and confirmed the user guide was in error and the blue light is supposed to remain lit when fully charged - Good to Know.The best praise one can give a product is if you would buy it again.  Since I just received a 2nd pair today, the answer to that is a resounding YES.Do these rival my $400 headphones?  Of course not, but for $59, they're mighty nice and well worth the purchase.  As you can see, twice!"

(I used these headphones exclusively for the gym, so about an hour or two every other day. Nothing extreme.)Random static pops are also beginning to occur and hot damn does it feel like a firecracker going off in your ear when they do. I've had to stop what I was doing mid exercise to pull out these headphones and check my ear for what felt like a popped ear drum way too frequently.And this is more of a personal pet peeve yet: I appreciate the headphones having a ""battery low"" message programmed into the headphones, but if the headphones are going to shut off in like a minute after the message (which will give you another message), do we really need the first one?Materials and battery life (about 4 hours continuous use) are actually pretty nice.Sound is decent BUT you have to pray your ears match one of the preset pads (granted there are 3 or so different sizes) because if they don't sit perfectly where they need to be they don't generate enough volume to overcome outside noise.(I.e. at the gym they have music on in the background. It's loud enough to cover minor sounds of like grunting or breathing but still quiet enough to be able to have a conversation at about normal speaking volume. These headphones cannot overcome that volume even at max if they aren't in an exact position.) So if you're someone who likes noise cancelling or can't tune out certain sounds...its a 50/50 (do or dont) shot if these will work for you.EDIT: Was contacted by customer service next day and they offered to take care of the issue. Even if they don't follow through (which is pending, not for certain) just the fact that they bothered to respond is enough to get me to give another star.

These headphones have been great so far and I can't really think of any substantial downsides. Others have done the in-depth sound and NC comparisons against Bose and Sennheiser, so I won't do that here.For commuting on trains and buses, these are fantastic. The noise cancelling is excellent, to the point where I've almost missed my stop because I couldn't hear the announcement. I've had a couple times where I've been in a cramped compartment with people talking and it becomes instant silence when I turn these on. The sound quality is also great. The low notes are very full without overwhelming everything else. I'm also hearing subtleties in my music that I haven't noticed before. I listen to a lot of rock, some electronic, and some lo-fi stuff, and these have been great with everything. Build quality is solid; I haven't once been concerned about cracking in the headband, but I treat these very well. I've had these for a couple months and I've only had to charge them twice.The only annoying thing I can think of with these is the earcup controls. It usually works well for volume, pausing, and switching tracks, but not 100%. There are times I'll swipe to turn up the volume, but it pauses instead. Or I try to forward a track and it pauses.

However, though I read through many reviews lauding the Bose noise-cancelling technology, as far as I'm concerned, it isn't all that great.The big problem with the noise cancellation is that it doesn't appear to suppress sudden loud noises such as a train door slamming--there is a momentary uncomfortable rise in ear pressure when that happens, and as a result it is far more distracting than when I wear the B&W headphones.As far as sound quality goes, the soundscape is nowhere near as rich as the B&Ws; there's something insubstantial about the sound coming from the Bose.  The Bose also aren't nearly as powerful, volume-wise--I have to turn them up to about 9 out of 10 to get the same volume I get at a 5 out of 10 on the B&W.At least there is one improvement on the QC 35s: they no longer have the booming bass of earlier models (I had some Bose QC 15s a few years ago that had terrible treble response and way too much bass); there is more of a flat response to these.  They sound best, ironically (and probably logically) in a very quiet environment, where they approach (but don't nearly exceed) the quality of the B&Ws.All in all, while the noise-cancelling properties of the newer B&W PX headphones (according to reviews) aren't as good as the QC 35s, I wish I had bought those instead."

It is clear that one is buying the wireless and fast charging technology in this device. There is a clear sound difference between these and the QC15. However, the higher treble tones as opposed to the lacking deeper BASS tones are a welcome aspect vs the prior. I use both sets for the gym and am currently playing Junior Boys, electronic and metal (Megadeth) to workout in. So, these are amazing. The leather and padding for the ears are not a super high quality but, the ly suffice. The main advantage is the lack of wire, super fast iPhone sync and amazingly rapid battery recharging time. That's where you get your money's worth. The battery indicator lights and iphone-headphone-like remote on the earpiece are wonderfully convenient.  I can answer calls, skip songs, repeat songs, etc etc just like the stock iPhone headphones just, these are built right into the bottom of the right ear piece. Again, very convenient.  There is a nice voice prompt that tells you how much battery life is left and where the device is connected to - this comes on upon turning the headphones on. With the QC15, I found the VERY LONG wire associated to the device highly annoying as they would routinely bother me during reps... even when wound up and tucked. However, again the QC15 had a superior sound quality. But, again, the wire was such a hassle. And battery replacement was a drag. Hands down and the noise cancellation was great with the QC15, given the cling and clang of the gym. However, bottom line, I am well pleased with what I have in these wireless BOSE. I will try the B&W at some point. But if I wait for next year's model, it won't surprise me. Very happy with the BOSE Soundlink."

After years of buying a new pair of earbuds every couple months, I discovered these.The only time I had to buy a new pair was when my mother stole my old ones thinking they were hers. Apparently weirdly shaped ears is a genetic thing and she, after experiencing the same problems with broken earbuds, independently discovered the exact same amazing headphones as me. We were both rocking the blue back then, but now I go with the silver.Everyone in my family has a different color assigned to them to avoid confusion. We buy extras and they sit in boxes unused because these cannot be killed. Went swimming in the ocean with these a couple times. They've been through the a washing machine spin cycle more times than I care to admit, but they keep on working.

Coming up from some pretty cheap gear, this are definitely in a better tier of quality. I'm not huge on bass, but these have a strong bass presence I don't find overwhelming.Decent passive noise reduction - blocks white noise well, and makes it easy to ignore nearby office chatter.The mechanism for folding in the cups is easy and feels like it won't wear out easily.One-button-hold for on/off/pairing was intuitiveNo issues with battery life so farNeutral:Plugging in the audio cable instantly powers them off - preserving battery but limiting featuresCon:Pressure on the ears - I have a large head and large ears, and it's tricky to get these to set so that they're not irritating my ears after a short time.  The description acknowledges you should take them off every couple hours, but I often have to adjust them repeatedly just a few minutes in to find the right angle.Volume controls - dual purpose track change/volume buttons haven't given me the best experience, unintentionally changing tracks or starting over. Volume adjusts in steps that are too large for my preferences, so I'm often left wanting to be halfway between two selectable levels (including when using the paired devices audio up/down buttons).Microphone - might work well in a quiet space, but mild background white noise in my office after everyone was gone (computer fans from other desks) made my caller think I was driving on speakerphone.

I would consider these good for general use without having any sound cancelling function.There is a tiny blue flashing LED light on one bud indicating that it's on.Sound quality during phone calls was also good.  Callers reported my voice being clear during calls.Bluetooth Range is very good, approx 50-60' in line of sight; slightly less when there are obstructions between the earbuds and your source.I've only needed to charge these twice, so I cannot speak to the battery life with any authority.  I have used these forms combined 5-6 hours with no issues whatsoever, So I suspect you can easily get a full day on one charge out of them.

Didn't think it would matter, but that's actually the size I need.The sound is okay, comparing them to similarly priced Apple headphones (wired) they are on par. Apple ones are better though, more balanced (these are more high and very little low), it has poor sound range, and these have a much thinner sound (that is it isn't full). But acceptable for the price.They are comfortable, they hold up well... for the side that I have the right sizes in, but unfortunately I'm missing the small buds for the other ear, so that side falls out.The mic quality mattered to me too, it's ok... Don't expect much if outside or around noise. In a quiet indoor room, it's fine. Again compared to Apple wired headphones, the apple ones are better. But those are not wireless.Overall everything was as I expected and ok, nothing that impressive. It's the price that really sells it for me.

I have smaller ears and found that many others were unbearable to wear after a short period of time.After purchasing the iPhone X I found the hassle of using the adapter to be annoying. In the end it was a blessing in disguise because when I exercise ( whether it be at the gym or on walks) the convenience of the wireless model is worthwhile. I can easily adjust the volume or answer phone calls with the control near my right ear.Also, being wire free is pretty great. Battery life so far has been really good. I use them in 1-2 hour blocks and they lose approximately 10% of their charge with each use.Another nice thing is that when you turn it on the headphones will tell you how much battery life is left.In researching other wireless headphone options I encountered many reviews where the other headphones would no longer hold an adequate charge for after months of use.I was able to purchase a 4 year Square Trade warranty for these headphones for only a little over $11.  That sealed the deal for me.I do admit that these are not as comfortable as the wired type (the receiver is in the earpiece so it is heavier than its wired version). My ears do ache a bit around the 2 hour mark. But as I mentioned before I have small ears (I use the smallest ear piece) so I???m not sure if that is a factor.I find the quality of the sound to be more than acceptable. I mainly listen to podcasts on my walks or stream movies while doing the elliptical. Haven???t tried to stream music yet but I???m pretty sure it will satisfy my needs.These are an investment compared to some other models but I truly believe that sometimes it???s worth paying more money for a quality product rather than having to replace other models more frequently."

Nylon workout clothes can be particularly annoying,Non-reversible earpieces. I suppose this could be a pro, since you'll NEVER accidentally get the left-right reversed when putting them in, but I like to wear these one eared sometimes, and I cant just use either side. I find them very soft in proper configuration, but trying to fit the wrong plug into the wrong ear is like scraping your skin with a tiny spoon.Pros:Noise-dampening. Especially when music is on, even with a light sound I can barely hear any background. People have to speak VERY loud to get me to hear, and even then its just noise not words.Solid sound. I'm no audiophile, but the bass in these is good enough to thoroughly enjoy the game of thrones theme. I can hear more of the subtleties than my 40$ pc speakers put out, even if they do have a woofer.SUPER COMFY! Unless i roll over on my side, which makes them press too far in, I can (and do) wear these for hours. The gel is very soft and seals the ear without putting pressure on it. They are more comfortable than my over-ear Headset.Durable as duct tape. I am really rough on them. Cords run over by office chairs (and sometimes the bud!), sat on, swung around like a ball-and-chain, chewed on, soaked in rain; I've abused these things like an angry linebacker, and they usually only break when i accidentally crush the earbud or slice the cord.

The sound was pretty good, but I could still hear the wind when I was running outside. And that's okay because after a few minutes I didn't think about the wind anymore and just the music. I never turned them up to full volume because they get very loud. I used them for yard work too. I could get 20ft from my phone before the sound would cut out, and I knew it was time to charge them when the sound would start cutting out 2feet from my phone while running. So after my 6months of use 1-3times a week they died. I did the research to get them to turn back on but they won't. I have never dropped them or tossed or abused them. I expected headphones to last more then 6months for the $37. I think I over paid. I would not repurchase these."

They are a little bass heavy for my taste even without the bass boost disabled. I can not recommend these headphones to anyone because even with light use and careful handling the arms that hold the ear cups have now broken in three different places. There is a channel that is carved out on the rear side of these arms(for wiring I assume) that hold the ear cups which reduces the strength of the arms. These arms have now broken in three different places and from the reviews here I can see that some other people are experiencing the same issues. I repaired them with sugru, but then a month or so later and they would break in a different place. This time I don't think that I can repair them and the warranty has now expired. Please see pictures for break areas and obvious break and repair points using blue and yellow sugru(I ran out of blue)."

However, after about 6 months of use, the earbuds would not turn on except when they were connected to power. They also would not connect to any of my devices.  I contacted Anker and they responded promptly with some suggestions on how to resolve the problem.  When none of that worked, they sent me out a new set which I received in 3-4 days.  The second set is working great so far.  Anker's customer service was prompt, courteous and easy to work with."

The quality of the material is superb and the app is easy to use for pairing your new earbuds and updating the firmware. I recommend a firmware update the minute you get them as it is a rather large update. It does, however, fix the left earbud drop off that some people have experienced in the past. Got to hand it to Bose for putting great sound quality in such a tiny space. Don't get these expecting the same quality you'd get from over the ear wired ones though. Still, very good quality sound. Crisp, clear, and rich bass and voice."

Crisp and clear and mildly noise cancelling.  I have a smallish and shaved head and only just fit.However, my one complaint is that they seem to have been a returned pair because the bass notes give a slight buzz. I don't know if this is due to price or if they are indeed used. And no, I do not listen to things at loud volume.Edit: The charging cord could stand to be about 6-12 inches longer as well."

They used them the whole airplane ride. I gave them a try, they are so comfortable. My 8 and 6 year old boys break EVERYTHING and these are still going strong, the cords are not like traditional cords so they're impossible to frey, break, rip. And they fold up very easily for storing. Love these headphones, so affordable!"

My husband uses them more than I do because the ear piece does not fit on my ear as well as his (the ear cuff does not hug my ears enough). But these are great for running and do not fall out. Cancels out noise very well!

Can a product be rated more than 5 stars? If so, this definitely deserves it. Yes, it is one of the most expensive headphones out there (not including those fancy pro studio headphones), but you totally get your money's worth. So, stop spending your hard earned cash on cheap headphones and make this one time investment on a premium headphone like this."
